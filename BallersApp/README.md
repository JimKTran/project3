<h3>Introduction</h3>

Using the data uploaded to SQLite, we will utilize D3.js to create 3 visualizations. The first wil compare two players (user selected from drop down). The second is a multi-line graph showing PER by position (user selects what position(s) to see). The third are a scatter plots showing player statistics (user selects the statistic).  Create an html page to display all the visualization deployed in Heroku.
