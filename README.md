<h3>Introduction</h3>

Using the data uploaded to MongoDB, we will utilize D3.js to create 3 visualizations. The first wil compare two players (user selected from drop down). The second is a multi-line graph showing PER by position (user selects what position(s) to see). The third is a scatter plot showing player salaries (user selects the team).Create a html page to display all those visualizations.
